    <h1 align="center">Historial Overview</h1><br>
    <p id="para">The National Library and the National Archives are rather young agencies, inasmuch 
        as the Library was founded in 1944 and the Archives only really attained a legal 
        existence in 1976. Nonetheless, the history of libraries is as old as the history 
        of written culture in Christian Ethiopia, as Ethiopians will proudly state in any 
        communication on the topic. Archive management in its modern signification was first 
        introduced during Menelik’s reign, around 1908, when he created a Ministry of the Pen 
        in charge of collecting the records of other ministries</p><br><br>
        <h1 id="title"> 1944-1953: The first years</h1><br>
    <p id="para">  The first attempt to create a central public library in 
        Addis Ababa dates back to the beginning of Haile Selassie’s reign. After the Italian occupation, 
        the bétä mäsahft wämäzagebtä ªebäbat wä-zéna ýalämat was founded on November 1943 and the King of 
        Kings inaugurated it on the 5th of May 19444 under the name Yä-Hezb Bétä Mäshäft wä-Mäzäker. On 
        this solemn day, exactly three years after the liberation, Haile Selassie declared: “It is perhaps 
        especially suitable that on this day of national liberation we should open this first National 
        Library of Our Empire. As we celebrate the liberation of our people, we lay the foundations for 
        the liberation of their minds. The first General Director wasSäräqä Berhan Gäbrä Egzi'abhér, a young and promising 
        intellectual, educated in the first graduating class of the Imperial School9 and having pursued his 
        education in Library Sciences during the war in Greece and Egypt10. He seems to have dedicated a lot of 
        energy to the development of the young institution, an involvement that led him to a promotion. He was 
        then replaced by Käbbädä Mikaél, the famous poet and writer. It may be as early as these first years that 
        Abba Jérome Gäbrä Musé was hired as keeper of manuscripts12. The origin of the first manuscript holdings 
        is not known; indeed, almost the entire history of this collection remains to be done.  </p><br><br>
        <h1 id="title">1953-1967: Expansion and competition</h1><br>
    <p id="para">  In 1953, the institution was placed under the authority
         of the newly created Imperial Board of Antiquities, headed by Käbbädä Mikaél. Some structural changes occurred.
          The “Library of the People was divided in two: the Public Library and the Research Library. The Public 
          Library had to perform a variety of duties. It had to build from scratch a network of libraries in the country. 
           The Public Division also offered services for readers such as book loans, consultation of Ethiopian and foreign 
           newspapers, a children's section and some Braille books for blind readers.Very soon a competition 
              arose between the two institutions, with the University Library claiming the right to absorb the Research Division of the National 
              Library, to obtain legal deposit and to publish a national bibliography. Rita Pankhurst describes this situation very clearly in her 
              article “Leadership in Ethiopian Post-war development: the National Library vs. the University Library”, pointing out all the handicaps, 
              failures and shortcomings of the National Library. This uninspiring image of the National Library was disseminated in the numerous 
              publications distributed in the international network of libraries resources by the university and the Institute of Ethiopian Studies, 
              as well as by the foreign experts sent by UNESCO, who all echoed this same sentiment. In the meantime, the National Library itself 
              had an almost total lack of public-relations policy.  
            </p><br><br>
            <h1 id="title">1967-77: Legal improvements and long-term projects</h1><br>
    <p id="para"> In 1967, the National Library was placed under the Ministry of Culture 
        and Sports. This was also the year when the Ethiopian Library Association was created. One of the main institutional changes was the 
        creation of a department for archives. The need to establish the archives more firmly was growing and the pre-revolutionary period realised 
        clearly the need for preserving official documents. The archives remained for some years a theoretical creation. This first attempt to give 
        birth to a National Archives which would be legally empowered to gather records came to fruition only a few weeks before the Revolution. In 
        July 1974, a committee under the Antiquities Administration proposed to the Prime Minister’s Office a draft structure for National Archives. 
        This program had no time to be realised. It was only a few years later, in 1977, that the National Archives Division was definitively founded. 
        It immediately became a member of the International Council for Archives (ICA). The Derg regime also valorised the growth of the National Library. 
        In 1975, the right of legal deposit was at last established by law38, substituting to an imperial letter addressed to each Ethiopian publishers but 
        that has proved not effective. Three copies of all printed materials issued in Ethiopia were henceforth to be deposited at the National Library. 
        The reorganization into four divisions was detailed by the General Director as followed: National Library Division; Historical Archives Division; 
        Technical Services Division; Public Services Division.  This period is also 
        noteworthy for the collection of manuscripts and the general policy toward the ancient written heritage of the country.</p><br><br>
           
        <h1 id="title">1977-1994: Realisations of Post-Revolutionary Ethiopia</h1><br>
        <p id="para"> A huge project that  benefited from National Library support is the 
            microfilming of manuscripts preserved in religious and private libraries. At the initiative of the Ethiopian Patriarch, abunä Téwoflos, it 
            was planned as early as 1973 to conduct an extensive campaign of reproduction of the manuscript heritage. The project started up very quickly 
            and was conducted during the entire Derg regime, as a collaboration between the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the Ethiopian Ministry of Culture, 
            the Divinity School of Vanderbilt (Nashville, Tennessee) and the American University of Saint Louis, Collegeville. The American side withdrew 
            in 1987 and the National Library carried on alone until 1991. Then, due to the political situation, the project had to stop. This is the reason 
            why only the National Library preserved the entire collection of 92 microfilmed manuscripts, while the Hill Monastic Manuscripts Library, as 
            well as the I.E.S. and the Patriarchate of the Orthodox Church, possess the first 74 microfilmed volumes. This collection covers a large 
            number of churches, in Addis Ababa, Shäwa, Gojjam, Bägémder and Gondär. Nonetheless, this coverage could not have been absolutely exhaustive, 
            for, in the absence of mobile microfilming unit, the churches had to transport their manuscripts to Addis Ababa to have them microfilmed at 
            the National Library. Understandably, some communities were reluctant to send all their manuscripts on the long and risky journey to the capital city.
            This unique collection of microfilmed manuscripts revealed new texts and made possible access to manuscripts still in the possession of their owners. 
            The first 5000 codices have been catalogued. In the field of archives, the historical collections –it is to say archives that are not gathered 
            directly at the ministerial record centres- found their way to the National Archives. First some governmental documents from the Imperial Era were 
            transferred to National Archives. The archives of the Royal Palace, also known as “Gebi archives”, were collected in 1987. This is a very heterogeneous 
            collection, composed of charters, topographical data, photos, letters, and documents concerning ports, boundaries, establishment of the air force, and 
            last but not least, the unification of Eritrea with the Ethiopian State49. At the same time the very rich archives of the crown Prince (Alga Waraš Gebi)
            were also collected; some of the documents were related for instance to the aborted coup of 1960. Historical collections were made of nationalised papers, 
            as those of däjjazmač Zäwdä Gäbrä Sellasé, a former highranked civil servant, coming from a family of Tigrean dignitaries,who had gathered for his Oxford 
            PhD a huge amount of papers concerning the 19th century Ethiopian internal and foreign policy. Institutional improvements continued at the time of the 
            overthrow of the Derg regime in 1991 and during the transition to a stable regime, thanks to the efforts of National Archives department’s successive 
            directors, of the different committees establishing recommendations and guide-lines and of the visits and advices of foreign experts mandated by the 
            International Council of Archives. Nation-wide, a civil service reform led to major institutional reforms54.  In June 1994 the Department of Ethiopian 
            Library and Archives was upgraded to an Agency, opening at last the way for a real national policy.During this period of improvement, the National Archives 
            acquired various historical collections, mainly from Ethiopian intellectuals. In 1993, the papers of the great historian aläqa Tayä Gäbrä Maryam (1860-1924) 
            were transferred from the Ethiopian Language Academy. In 1996, the archives of blata Märs’e Hazän Wäldä Qirqos and däjjazmač Käbbädä Täsämma, both of them 
            dignitaries of the Imperial regime and historians who had recorded their own views on the political life of the 20th century, were transferred from Brana 
            printing press. In 1997, the records from the Censorship unit of the Ministry of Culture during the Derg Regime were acquired. Then, in 2000, some archives 
            concerning the Ethiopian monastery of Jerusalem were transferred, also from the Ministry of Culture.  </p><br><br>

            <h1 id="title">1994 onward: a new legal frame and the birth of Wemezeker(NALA) </h1><br>
    <p id="para">The National Library and its National Archives department were reorganised 
        and strengthened by the issuance in June 1999 of a law, the “Ethiopian National Archives and Library Proclamation n°179/1999,57 giving them a legal framework 
        and a nation-wide mandate. This proclamation lays the groundwork for setting up a reliable policy for NALE, which starting in 1999 was considered as an Agency 
        within the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Information and within the Ministry of Culture and Tourism since the October 2005 change of government58. The 
        proclamation details with great care the powers and duties of the National Archives and the National Library. With the responsibility for collecting, preserving 
        and making available the information resources of the country (precisely defined), it must initiate regulations and directives, inspect their implementation, 
        ensure professional training, and represent the country with regard to international collaboration. Following the proclamation, a large restructuring process 
        was undertaken which was put into effect in 2003: the National Library and the National Archives were upgraded as two distinct directions with new departments. 
        As the proclamation states: “Where found necessary, Archives and Library may be established separately and have their respective autonomous body” (Part. I, art. 4/1). 
        Their common services have been redefined.
        With this 1999 proclamation, the long-planned new building for the Agency became a concrete reality. The budget of more a 30 million Birr was provided by the Ethiopian 
        government and some Ethiopian sponsors, and the stone corner was laid on December 2002. </p> <br><br><br>
